# uni_sinking_ships
University Group Project Sept 16 - Jan 17.

For the hack, the project will consist of three HTML pages:
- Welcome page
- Instructions/ rules page
- Game play page. - currently index.html

Within the HTML page, the layout is created and styling added by referencing external CSS scripts. It is also within <script> tags that links to our javascript scripts will sit.

Game should be started by opening welcome.html. Gameplay is within index.html

All testing has been carried out in chrome.

Known issues:

On smaller screens it is possible that the two grids do not appear next to each other, this can be resolved by 
zooming out.

Currently the game only runs with a 10x10 Grid and 5 ships.

In this release all ships are in a fixed location.
