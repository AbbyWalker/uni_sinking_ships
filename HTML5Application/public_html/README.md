Game should be started by opening welcome.html. Gameplay is within index.html

All testing has been carried out in chrome.

Known issues:

On smaller screens it is possible that the two grids do not appear next to each other, this can be resolved by 
zooming out.

Currently the game only runs with a 10x10 Grid and 5 ships.

In this release all ships are in a fixed location.
